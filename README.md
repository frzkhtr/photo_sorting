### Sorting my camera photos based on their context. For now, that context is location(city).  \n My aim is to sort photos on whatever content they have. All photos will remain in original backup folder.  \n Just its shorcut will be put in the respective tag folder. \n Hence 1 photos can be present under many tags witout consuming much space.
